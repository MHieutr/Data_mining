# Notes
## File DT_RF
- Implementing Decision Tree and Random Forest from scratch (Probaly credible)
- After running 3 class (Node, Decision Tree, Random Forest), we can now build a Random Forest model with iris dataset (from the datasets of sklearn) 
### Description of iris.csv
- 150 rows, 5 cols
- class distributions: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica
## File Data_mining
- Using 3 dataset (Wine.csv, Brain.csv, Prostate.csv)
- Performing the accuracy, time-running of model
- The contribution of choosing number of tree in each Random Forest model.
